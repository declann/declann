### Hi there 👋
I'm Declan. I work with numbers, mostly in actuarial departments. 📊  
I also develop [calculang](https://github.com/calculang/calculang), with a mission to democratise numbers. A life project and still a baby. :seedling:

:hatching_chick: check [my ObservableHQ collection](https://observablehq.com/collection/@declann/calculang) for some really early calculang models and interactions.
