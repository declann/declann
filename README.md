### Hi there 👋

I'm Declan. I work with numbers, mostly in actuarial departments. 📊  

I also develop [calculang](https://calculang.dev), a language for calculations 🧮💬👩‍💻

and I published [ActuarialPlayground.com](https://actuarialplayground.com): a visual and interactive actuarial cashflow model.

In [my blog](https://calcwithdec.dev/) I share posts about numbers that are also visual and interactive. I share some videos [on Youtube](https://youtube.com/@calcwithdec) too.

To collaborate on calculang-related projects and goals, get in touch.

📫 calculang updates mostly via Fosstodon [@calculang](https://fosstodon.org/@calculang) sometimes [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/declann)

Find other public repos [on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/declann).
